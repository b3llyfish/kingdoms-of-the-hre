[h1]Kingdoms of the HRE[/h1]
Mod that changes how Kingdoms are formed in the HRE for both the player and AI.
These changes apply to both existing HRE Kingdoms and creatable ones.

[h2]Key Details[/h2]

[b]Kingdoms[/b]
* Kingdoms within the HRE's '[i]sphere of influence[/i]' can no longer be created manually by vassals of the HRE
* HRE vassals will need to petition the Emperor in order to be granted a Kingdom title
* The Emperor will be given the options to either bestow the Kingdom title or reject the petition, risking further trouble with the vassal
* Improve your change of acceptance by swaying the Emperor, or guarantee it with a strong hook blackmail...
* Form new HRE Kingdoms of Upper Saxony, Lower Saxony, Carinthia or Slavinia
* Flavorization changes rename Kingdoms (with some exceptions) to Principalities to better reflect the structure of the HRE

[b]Cultures[/b]
* Requires the Royal Court DLC
* Characters who are not culture heads may be given the option to diverge or convert their culture
* See more unique cultures such as Austrian, Lothringian or Upper Saxon

[b]Decisions[/b]
* Decisions to form Austria and Switzerland have been removed and instead incorporated into this mod
* As a Saxon prince unite your people to form the Kingdom of Saxony!
* As an archduke of Austria establish your dynasty to gain early access to single heir succession
* As the leader of the Swiss Confederation build cities to receive region wide buffs from the Cantons

[b]Artifacts[/b]
* Gain a crown to kick-start your reign upon gaining a Kingdom
* Also receive the Golden Bull used to justify your reign as a court artifact

[h2]FAQ[/h2]

[h3]Would you be able to add in [i]some other[/i] Kingdom title?[/h3]
In regard to adding new Kingdoms this mod's purpose was to break up the German (East Francia) Kingdom into smaller parts.
I feel that this has been achieved with the addition of Lower and Upper Saxony therefore I am unlikely to add more Kingdoms.

The code should be easy enough to follow for modders who are interested.

[h3]Does this work with the 867 start date?[/h3]
This mod works with the 867 start date (more specifically the 'Restore Holy Roman Empire' decision) and special consideration has made for the French Kingdoms.

Should the Empire to formed with the French Kingdoms as de jure (i.e Charles 'the Bald' restores the Empire), then the French Kingdoms will be added to the petition options.

The Kingdom of Upper Saxony will have slightly easier requirements in the 867 start due to the existence of Sorbia.

[h3]Is this mod compatible with [i]mod that adds/changes/removes titles[/i]?[/h3]
Unfortunately due to code limitations the major changes made by this mod are static. Any changes that go about adding/changing/removing titles that this mod changes will most likely be incompatible.

Whilst unlikely to crash your game you may see things like orphaned duchy titles which may have a negative impact.

[h3]Could you make a compatibility patch for [i]mod that adds/changes/removes titles[/i]?[/h3]
Apologies but due to the large amount of mods out there I am not interested in making compatibility patches at this point in time.

[h3] Similar Mods [/h3]
These mods do similar things and could be use an alternative. They are assumed to be incompatible with this mod.

[h2] Localization [/h2]
This mod only supports [b]English[/b] localization at present. I'm hoping to find a solution to support basic localization for all
supported languages in the near future.

Below lists localization support from other modders. If your preferred locale appears below please download that mod as I will
not be providing any basic localization for this language.
